*****      My name is Alex Shriver and I love fantasy sports. Lucky for me,
*****      my dad does too. He's been in an iconic league founded in our
*****      small town of Brattleboro, Vermont for years. The league is 
*****      called the Green Mountain Rotisserie League, and has been active
*****      since the 90s. In its many years of operation, the rules of the
*****      league have evolved from a simple keeper rotisserie league to a
*****      highly intricate and unique fantasy experience. As such, by the 
*****      time my dad invited me to the league, there were so many special 
*****      rules that no online fantasy baseball drafting website could 
*****      effectively support our auction draft format, despite the website
*****      onroto.com effectively running the show during the season.
*****
*****      After two years in the league, I was already sick of drafting by
*****      hand, being forced to scratch off names from paper lists as they 
*****      were drafted, having little indication of how to evaluate the 
*****      remaining players. So, a few days before 2023 season's draft, 
*****      I came up with the idea to write a program to do it for me! That 
*****      week, I didn't sleep much as I worked tirelessly to finish this 
*****      program before the draft started whilst keeping up with my classes.
*****
*****      I finished just in time, pulling an all-nighter before the draft.
*****      I put the final touches on my favorite personal project just an 
*****      hour before the first pick. 
*****
*****      Today is a warm October Thursday, and I am writing about this 
*****      story after successfully utilizing the program to draft my best
*****      team ever. In fact, it was so good that I won the league!
*****
*****      Now, before the 2024 draft starts, I hope to clean this program up,
*****      expand its capabilities to support a multi-team draft, and per-
*****      haps even build a website around it so the whole league can use
*****      it--even though that would take away my advantage!

----- ARCHITECTURE ------ 
batter_database: This class handles storing the available batters
                 and all the operations to manipulate the database

pitcher_database: This class handles storing the available pitchers
                 and all the operations to manipulate the database

batter: This class handles representing individual batters and manipulating
        information about them

pitcher: This class handles representing individual pitchers and manipulating
         information about them

draft: The driver file that contains the main function for executing the
       drafter program



----- COMPILATION ------
To compile the drafter, run Make OnRoto_Drafter

----- POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS ------
    - Handle TODOs
    - Generally use more exceptions
    - Think about using more inheritance. For instance, could batters and 
      pitchers inherit from a player superclass? Could I combine the two databases?
